# Sprint 4-Software Development Integrated Project: Vehicle App

Our new vehicle application is designed to enhance the car-buying experience by offering intuitive tools for exploring and analyzing car data. A key feature is the **Select Menu by Car Model**, which allows customers to easily choose their preferred car model from a dropdown menu and view detailed information about the models available for sale. To further refine their search, a dynamic slider lets users filter car models by their production year, providing a streamlined browsing experience. Additionally, the application includes robust **Price Analysis** tools, featuring a histogram and scatterplot to visualize price trends. These charts analyze key factors such as vehicle age, odometer readings, condition, type, and fuel requirements, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions with clear and comprehensive data insights.
